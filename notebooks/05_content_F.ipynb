    "As an alternative to collaborative filtering explored in previous notebooks, **content-based filtering** relies on the intrinsic features of items rather than user–item interactions across the entire population. The main idea is to represent each movie as a **feature vector** capturing its attributes, and to construct a **user profile** by aggregating the features of movies the user has previously liked. The predicted preference for a new movie is then determined by the **similarity** between the user profile and the movie feature vector.\n",

    "In this experiment, we use **cosine similarity** as the measure of similarity between the user profile and an unseen movie vector. The motivation for this choice lies in how cosine similarity emphasizes **alignment in feature space** rather than absolute magnitude. In this implementation, the user profile is constructed as a weighted aggregation of movie feature vectors, where the weights correspond to the ratings assigned by the user. Although this aggregation is normalized by the sum of the weights, the resulting vector may still exhibit differences in magnitude due to variations in how concentrated or diverse a user’s preferences are across feature dimensions. As a result, similarity measures that are sensitive to vector magnitude, such as the dot product, may assign systematically higher scores to users whose profiles have larger norms, regardless of how well the underlying feature patterns align.\n",

    "- **Movie genres**: The 19 distinct genres are encoded using **one-hot encoding**, providing a categorical representation of the movie type.\n",
    "- **Bayesian-adjusted rating**: This measure is included to capture the overall quality and community appraisal of a movie. It is preferred over the simple average rating, as it accounts for differences in popularity, exposure, and review count, thereby mitigating the influence of movies with very few ratings.\n",
    "- **Decade of release**: The decade is derived from the release year to provide a coarse temporal context. This feature allows movies to be compared in terms of their production period, capturing similarity across time.\n",

    "- **Tag relevance scores**: User-provided tags are incorporated as an additional source of content information. Given the large number of distinct tags (1128), variance-based filtering followed by **PCA** is applied to reduce dimensionality while retaining the most informative components for movie comparison.\n",

    "As previously explained, the 1128 user-provided tags are first filtered based on the variance of their relevance scores, sorted in descending order. The purpose of this initial subsetting is twofold. First, it removes tags that appear frequently across most movies but provide little discriminatory or explanatory power for distinguishing between movies. Second, it filters out extremely rare tags that are only associated with a few movies and are unlikely to contribute meaningfully to overall similarity computations. To balance these considerations, we retain the top 50% of tags by variance. These selected tags are then processed using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for further dimensionality reduction, following the variance-explained principle. This step ensures that the final tag representation captures the most informative patterns while reducing the dimensionality, making it suitable for integration with the other features in the `movies_vector`.\n"

    "Under the principle of parsimony and for the purpose of data reduction in our tag relevance representation, we opt for `k = 140`, which captures approximately 90%% of the variance in the original matrix. While this results in a loss of about 10% of the total variance (excluding the information already filtered out in the initial variance-based subsetting), it allows us to obtain a more compact and expressive movie vector that can be more efficiently handled during training and evaluation.\n"

This ensures that all features have comparable magnitudes and behave well during similarity computation. In contrast, one-hot encoded genres do not require standardization, as their dummy structure is already suitable for similarity measures. The PCA components are also left as-is, since they are already centered and provide an expressive, structured representation with magnitudes comparable to the other standardized variables.\n"

    "From the validation set, we can observe the marginal contribution of each feature group and how their combination provides the most informative vector representation for movies in the content-based model. As expected, tag-based features have a larger impact on predictive performance compared to genres. However, this should be interpreted with caution because the majority of movies are “warm” items, while a few receive little signal. During vector preparation, some movies had no PCA signal because their tags were filtered out by the variance cutoff. In these cases, genre features still provided useful information, helping to distinguish movie types where the PCA tags could not."
